# Hello-World
The beginning of my programming journey.

Paul is the name and learning programming is the game. I am currently learning Java programming on Udemy through Tim Buchalka, the course that I am taking on there is called "Java programming Masterclass for Software Developers" I am currently working towards databases, however instead of starting with them straight away I would like to learn a programming language to give me a better fundamental understanding of all languages. I am currently working on creating my own program with what I have learned on Udemy class.

Anyhow, I hope you all are having a great time and I hope to increase this readme in the next year with examples of what I have learned! Happy coding everyone!
